    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g pancetta</li>
        <li>50g pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>50g parmesan</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>350g spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</li>
        <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate the pecorino cheese and parmesan and mix them together.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti, and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente.</li>
        <li>Squash the garlic cloves with the blade of a knife to bruise them.</li>
        <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop the butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as it melts, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</li>
        <li>Cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and discard it.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and add it to the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if some water drops into the pan, and don’t throw away the pasta water yet.</li>
        <li>Mix most of the cheese with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling later.</li>
        <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture. Use tongs or a long fork to lift the spaghetti so it mixes with the egg mixture, which should thicken but not scramble, coating the pasta evenly.</li>
        <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep the dish saucy, a few tablespoons at a time as needed. Season with a little salt if required.</li>
        <li>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta onto the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish gets too dry, add a splash of hot pasta water to restore its glossy texture.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
