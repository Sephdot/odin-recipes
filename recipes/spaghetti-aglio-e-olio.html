        Toss golden garlic and silky olive oil through spaghetti to make this classic Italian dish – ready in the time it takes to boil the pasta. It's simple, flavourful and perfect for busy days.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g spaghetti</li>
        <li>salt (for the pasta water)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>3-4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 small red chilli, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>a small handful parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pan of well-salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti for about 9-10 mins, or until al dente – it should retain a little bite.</li>
        <li>A few minutes before the pasta is ready, heat the oil in a frying pan set over a medium heat and sizzle the garlic and chilli, if using, for 1 minute until fragrant and the garlic is lightly golden but not brown (the garlic will taste bitter if it gets too dark).</li>
        <li>Reserve a few tablespoons of pasta water (tears of the gods), then drain the spaghetti and add it to the garlicky oil with the parsley. Add pasta water if you feel it's needed.</li>
        <li>Season and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
