        Prepare this easy homemade lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a busy week.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leftover cooked lasagne can be covered and chilled for up to 3 days, ready to be reheated as is or in portions.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>750g beef mince</li>
        <li>90g prosciutto</li>
        <li>800g passata</li>
        <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
        <li>whole nutmeg, ready to grate using a Microplane</li>
        <li>300g fresh lasagne sheets</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/white-sauce" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">bechamel sauce</a></li>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella (torn into thin strips)</li>
        <li>fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>(optional) white wine (for deglazing)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and cook the beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over. If the beef mince catches, add a splash of white wine and scrub rapidly with a wooden spoon to deglaze.</li>
        <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto, reserving the rest, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour over the passata and the hot beef stock. Add a small amount of grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
        <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li>
        <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then make a single layer with fresh lasagne sheets. Drizzle over roughly 130g white sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</li>
        <li>Scatter the mozzarella over the top.</li>
        <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Top with shredded basil just before serving.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
